        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>My main hobby currently is learning <strong>Rust</strong>. I plan to use Rust for my Capstone Project, whatever that ends up being.</p>
        <p>In my spare time I like to learn <strong>Design Patterns</strong> and implement them in different languages, like <strong>Typescript, Rust,</strong> and <strong>C++.</strong></p>

        <h2>Gaming</h2>
        <p>Nowadays during breaks from school, I play mostly <strong>Warhammer</strong> and <strong>Hearthstone</strong></p>
        <p>In my prime (2015-2019) I was a competitive fighting game player. My highest rank was 88th in North America
            for <strong>Mortal Kombat X</strong>

        <h3>Sports</h3>
        <p>I have played <strong>Basketball</strong> since I was 8. I have done Muay Thai, Boxing, and Krav Maga for about 3 years.</p>
        <p>I don't know if you would consider it a sport, but my mom's side of the family has been taking my money playing Poker since I was 12, which has made me decent at <strong>Texas Hold'em.</strong></p>
