      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>I was born in Baltimore Maryland weighing 2.2 lbs. I was born 18 weeks early, with the best case being severe brain damage. Despite the circumstances, I have no serious physical or mental disabilities. I thank God for my health, but just like everyone else, I have had my own share of obstacles in my life, particularly with motivation. The first time I ever felt the fire in my chest that everyone tells me about was about 10 months ago, in December 2022. I started learning basic web development using only HTML and CSS. It was nothing special, but that was the first time in my life I got immediate emotional feedback from the work I was doing. Since then, my passion for learning Computer Science has grown more than any subject or hobby in my life. It is a very broad and complicated field, and I am not even close to proficient, but I am certain I will one day. Since then, the fire has dimmed a bit and I do not have the same emotional reaction from practicing web development, but I remain focused in hopes that one day my efforts will pay off.
